  description: >-
    <p>While under the effect of <strong>Astral Fire</strong>, your
    fire-aspected abilities deal an additional 1d6 damage and you do not recover
    MP at the end of the [Adventurer Step]. <strong>Astral Fire</strong> is
    removed when you are <strong>Knocked Out</strong>, or, if the effect is not
    renewed, at the end of your next turn. Being granted <strong>Umbral
    Ice</strong> removes this effect as well.</p>
