  description: >-
    <p>On your turn, after resolving the effects of an ability that enables this
    trait, you may forgo all standard movement until the end of your turn to use
    an additional invoked primary ability. You may choose a new target when
    using this additional ability. <strong>Consecutive Invocation</strong> can
    only be used once per turn, and does not prevent you from using focus to
    perform an additional secondary action.</p>
