    <h3>Damage Upgrades on Existing Attacks</h3><p><strong>Heavy Shot</strong>:
    Base damage typically goes up from 2 to 3.</p><p><strong>Quick
    Nock</strong>: Its AoE damage improves (e.g. from 2 to
    3).</p><p><strong>Venomous Bite + Windbite</strong>: The DOT portion
    increases (e.g. from 4 up to 6).</p><p><strong>Straight Shot</strong>:
    Higher base damage.</p><h3>New Instant Abilities</h3><p><strong>Rain of
    Death</strong></p><p>A ranged AoE instant that deals damage to multiple
    enemies in an area.</p><p>Often shares usage limits with Bloodletter (so you
    can’t spam both in the same turn).</p><p><strong>Battle
    Voice</strong></p><p>A party buff that grants your allies an “advantage” or
    bonus die on their next check this phase.</p><p>Great for coordinating big
    hits or crucial skill checks.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>In short, at 50 you gain
    potent new tools for AoE damage (Rain of Death) and party support (Battle
    Voice), while your core single‐target shots (Heavy/Straight Shot,
    Venomous/Windbite) also hit harder. The Bard effectively rounds out its kit
    with stronger damage, bigger utility buffs, and a stronger overall “song
    cycle” than it had at 30–40.</p>
